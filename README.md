# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Resources
- Javascript, bootstrap, HTML, CSS, VSCode

## Results
The website "The Truth Is Out There" has been created, visitors will see the below and be able to directly interact with the website in navigating a variety of search criteria (date, city, state, country and shape).

### All Data is Displayed Initially:

### Visitors Can Narrow Search Criteria Results:

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
while this interactive website is helpful for visitors to navigate through the data gathered, it does have a significant drawback.  Specifically the Search Criteria table is case sensitive, it will not display the requested data unless an exact match is made.  Such as if you enter denver you will see data, but not if you enter Denver. Visitors will also not inately know to hit enter since we took the "filter table" button away.  I alievated this issue by typing in instructions below the Search Criteria header to let visitors know to hit enter.  Another drawback is that this data is only as relevant as when it was pulled, it is static data.

### Recommendations for Further Development:
1. It would be helpful to have drop down options in the search criteria, versus relying on the users to know the correct syntax to enter.
2. Making this website live in regards to its data would keep it up to date, such as with using a daily API pull from resources.
3. Lastly, adding in a section on "recent news" or "articles" would make the site more interactive and be a better resource for UFO data as well as news articles, getting more traffic to the site.
